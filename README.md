☕ Java Learning Journey 🚀
Welcome to my Java Learning Repository!
This repository is a personal project to track my progress as I learn Java — from the simplest "Hello World" program to complex menu-driven applications and object-oriented examples.

📚 About This Repository
This repo is designed to:

Practice core Java concepts

Learn by writing and organizing actual code

Understand how to use Git and GitHub effectively

Maintain clean, modular, and well-documented projects

Each concept or program is stored in its own folder, with:

📄 README.md explaining the code

🧠 Well-commented Java source files

✅ Sample output or usage instructions
